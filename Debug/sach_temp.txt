Don Quixote                                                           Miguel De Cervantes                     Don Quixote - the first modern novel - remains the finest. As a new translation of the Spanish classic is published, Harold Bloom argues that only Shakespeare comes close to Cervantes' genius. What is the true object of Don Quixote's quest? I find that unanswerable. What are Hamlet's authentic motives? We are not permitted to know. Since Cervantes's magnificent knight's quest has cosmological scope and reverberation, no object seems beyond reach. Hamlet's frustration is that he is allowed only Elsinore and revenge tragedy. Shakespeare composed a poem unlimited, in which only the protagonist is beyond all limits. Cervantes and Shakespeare, who died almost simultaneously, are the central western authors, at least since Dante, and no writer since has matched them, not Tolstoy or Goethe, Dickens, Proust, Joyce.
Pilgrim's Progress                                                    John Bunyan                             The English novel begins behind bars, in extremis. Its first author, John Bunyan, was a Puritan dissenter whose writing starts with sermons and ends with fiction. His famous allegory, the story of Christian, opens with a sentence of luminous simplicity that has the haunting compulsion of the hook in a great melody. "As I walk'd through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place, where was a Denn; And I laid me down in that place to sleep: And as I slept I dreamed a Dream." A "Denn" is a prison, and Bunyan wrote most of the book in Bedford county gaol, having been arrested for his beliefs during the "Great Persecution" of 1660-1690. He shares the experience of prison with Cervantes, who had the idea for Don Quixote while incarcerated in La Mancha. Like so many novels that follow in this list, The Pilgrim's Progress blends fact and fiction.
Robinson Crusoe                                                       Daniel Defoe                            English fiction began with The Pilgrim’s Progress, but nearly 50 turbulent years, including the Glorious Revolution, passed before it made its great leap forward. The author of this literary milestone is a strangely appealing literary hustler of nearly 60 years old originally named Daniel Foe (he added “De” to improve his social standing), a one-time journalist, pamphleteer, jack of all trades and spy. Like Bunyan, he had suffered at the hands of the state (the pillory, followed by prison in 1703). Unlike Bunyan, he was not religious. His world-famous novel is a complex literary confection. It purports to be a history, written by Crusoe himself, and edited by Daniel Defoe who, in the preface, teasingly writes that he “believes the thing to be a just History of Fact; neither is there any Appearance of Fiction in it”.
Gulliver's Travels                                                    Jonathan Swift                          Seven years after the publication of Robinson Crusoe, the great Tory essayist and poet Jonathan Swift – inspired by the Scriblerus club, whose members included John Gay and Alexander Pope – composed a satire on travel narratives that became an immediate bestseller. According to Gay, Gulliver was soon being read “from the cabinet council to the nursery”. In its afterlife as a classic, Gulliver’s Travels works on many levels. First, it’s a masterpiece of sustained and savage indignation, “furious, raging, obscene”, according to Thackeray. Swift’s satirical fury is directed against almost every aspect of early 18th-century life: science, society, commerce and politics. Second, stripped of Swift’s dark vision, it becomes a wonderful travel fantasy for children, a perennial favourite that continues to inspire countless versions, in books and films.
Tom Jones                                                             Henry Fielding                          How many readers, if they are honest, discovered some of the greatest novels through film or television? Gatsby? Pride and Prejudice? The English Patient? Dr Zhivago? I first got interested in Tom Jones having seen John Osborne's famous adaptation, starring the young Albert Finney as the eponymous hero. That's an exceptional film. Classics often don't make good films, or only do so – such as Oliver! – through a process of reinterpretation. Tom Jones, however, might have been made for the screen. Never mind its numerous chapters and teeming cast of misfits and scoundrels, the central character is an attractively unbridled young man of fierce temper and unrestrained sexuality who pursues true love through contemporary Britain in a sequence of scandalous and hilarious adventures.
Clarissa                                                              Samuel Richardson                       After The Pilgrim's Progress and Robinson Crusoe, the next landmark in English fiction is a towering monument of approximately 970,000 words, Clarissa, the longest novel in the English canon. From time to time, its length is challenged by later upstarts – most recently by Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace – but Samuel Richardson's The History of a Young Lady remains an extraordinary achievement. To Samuel Johnson, it was simply "the first book in the world for the knowledge it displays of the human heart". Most critics agree that it is one of the greatest European novels, whose influence casts a long shadow. I first read Clarissa, in France, in a gold-tooled library edition of many volumes. In the house where I was staying there was nothing else to read in English; I picked it up quite ignorant of its reputation and importance.
Tristram Shandy                                                       Laurence Sterne                         Tristram Shandy and its author, Laurence Sterne, are so intensely modern in mood and attitude, so profanely alert to the nuances of the human comedy, and so engaged with the narrative potentiality of the genre that it comes as something of a shock to discover that the novel was published during the seven years war. In other words, it appeared during the annus mirabilis of that prototype of international warfare that saw stunning British military victories in India, Canada and the Caribbean, and established the first British empire that would send the English language around the world. Some of the raw ebullience of the national mood is mirrored in the slightly mad pages of this uniquely entertaining novel. "Shandy" is a word of obscure origin meaning "crack-brained, half-crazy". Tristram himself says he is writing a "civil, nonsensical, good-humoured Shandean book". 
Dangerous Liaisons                                                    Pierre Choderlos De Laclos              Tresolved to write a book that would be quite outside the ordinary trend, which would make a sensation and echo over the world after I left it," Pierre Ambroise François Choderlos de Laclos wrote of his first and only novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Published in April 1782, Les Liaisons was an immediate sensation, a succès de scandale. Yet later it would be banned in France, and denounced - despite its own insistent morality - as immoral; it would not be translated into English until the 1920s when it was celebrated by, among others, Virginia Woolf. The first major film adaptation was Roger Vadim's dismal offering of 1959, starring Jeanne Moreau and Gerard Philipe. Today, Les Liaisons continues to be translated to the stage and screen: the novel seemingly being reinterpreted for each new generation.
Emma                                                                  Jane Austen                             How on earth to choose just one Jane Austen novel? Austen, for some, is simply the supreme English novelist, on any list. Some will say: she is the greatest. Nominate all six, from Pride and Prejudice on. But the rules of our selection only allow one title per author: there has to be a choice. So, to represent her fiction here, I've chosen Emma for three particular reasons. First, it's my personal favourite, a mature and brilliant comedy of manners (and much more besides) completed towards the end of her life. Second, published by John Murray, Emma takes us into a new literary landscape, the beginnings of a book world that lingers unto the 21st century. And third, most importantly of all, Austen's last novel has the sparkle of early books such as Pride and Prejudice.
Frankenstein                                                          Mary Shelley                            The summer of 1816 was a washout. After the cataclysmic April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora on the island of Sumbawa, part of what is now Indonesia, the world's weather turned cold, wet and miserable. In a holiday villa on the shores of Lake Geneva, a young English poet and his lover, the guests of another poet, discouraged from outdoor pursuits, sat discussing the hideousness of nature and speculating about the fashionable subject of "galvanism". Was it possible to reanimate a corpse? The villa was Byron's. The other poet was Shelley. His future wife, 19-year-old Mary Shelley (nee Godwin), who had recently lost a premature baby, was in distress. When Byron, inspired by some fireside readings of supernatural tales, suggested that each member of the party should write a ghost story to pass the time.
Nightmare Abbey                                                       Thomas Love Peacock                     Nightmare Abbey, like Frankenstein (no 8 in this series), appeared in 1818. Strangely, it was also inspired by Shelley, who was friends with Peacock. His satire, however, was lighthearted and whimsical and a kind of in-joke. There's no way of knowing if Peacock had actually read Mary Shelley's novel, but Nightmare Abbey makes a nice counterpoint, and speaks of the importance of a new audience. The regency was a turning point for English fiction. It was not only that the prince regent was a man of culture who adored the works of Jane Austen, there was also a wholly new market for novels: middle-class readers with money, enthusiasm and taste. Now they were known, talked about and sometimes even well-paid. In the beginning, the review process had been patchy and vulnerable to actual violence. Now there were some influential magazines in play.
The Black Sheep                                                       Honore De Balzac                        One morning this summer, I got up at first light – I'd left the blinds open the night before – then drank a strong cup of coffee, sat near-naked by an open window for an hour, worked all morning, then had a martini with lunch. I took a long afternoon walk, and for the rest of the week experimented with never working for more than three hours at a stretch. This was all in an effort to adopt the rituals of some great artists and thinkers: the rising-at-dawn bit came from Ernest Hemingway, who was up at around 5.30am, even if he'd been drinking the night before; the strong coffee was borrowed from Beethoven, who personally counted out the 60 beans his morning cup required. Benjamin Franklin swore by "air baths", which was his term for sitting around naked in the morning, whatever the weather. And the midday cocktail was a favourite of VS Pritchett (among many others).
The Charterhouse of Parma                                             Stendhal                                Penetrating and compelling chronicle of life in an Italian court in post-Napoleonic France. 
The Count of Monte Cristo                                             Alexandre Dumas                         The Count of Monte Cristo is a wonderful tale of one man's revenge against three friends who falsely accused him of helping Napoleon topple Louis XVIII. Having spent 14 years rotting away in prison as a result of their lies, he escapes with the complicity of a rich abbot and reinvents himself as a powerful, dangerous and seductive count for whom revenge is all that matters. The novel possesses all the elements of the best epic adventures: a chilling intrigue, a tragic love story, and numerous power struggles. Above all, the poetic ending is the best conclusion to a book you'll ever read. Given the countless Hollywood adaptations of the adventures of D'Artagnan, Athos, Portos and Aramis, you probably know the plot of the Musketeers already. Set in 17th century France, D'Artagnan dreams of joining the prestigious company of the Musketeers to serve his king.
Sybil                                                                 Benjamin Disraeli                       For more than a decade after the death of Jane Austen in 1817, the English novel was rather in the doldrums, a reflection of the times. English literary culture was making the transition from the high camp of the Regency to the hard grind of early Victorian society. A brilliant new generation would burst on the scene in the late 30s and early 40s. For the moment, the leading novelists of the age were Sir Walter Scott and his protege, "the great Maria", Maria Edgeworth, the Irish-born author of Castle Rackrent and Leonora. Rightly or wrongly, I am choosing to pass over these names for the list on the grounds that I do not know enough about their work to make a good judgment. Meanwhile, the British readership was avid. There was, more than ever, a booming market for new fiction. The novel had become the medium in which ambitious young writers could make a splash. 
David Copperfield                                                     Charles Dickens                         David Copperfield was the first book Sigmund Freud gave his fiancee, Martha Bernays, on their engagement in 1882. It was the gift of a lifelong Anglophile to his beloved, a book encrypted with peculiar meaning to a man with a special fascination for the complicated relation of autobiography to storytelling. Freud's choice – and Dickens's own opinion that David Copperfield was "of all my books" the one he liked "the best" – helps clarify an impossible selection midway through the 19th century. At the outset, I'm going to anticipate your howls of rage. Some Dickens aficionados will be dismayed. Why not Pickwick Papers? Or, better still, Great Expectations? Or Bleak House? Or Little Dorrit? And why not, here in the holiday season, that festive evergreen A Christmas Carol? Or the granite brilliance of Hard Times? Yes, in different ways, all masterpieces. Everyone has their favourite. This is mine.
Wuthering Heights                                                     Emily Bronte                            The above image of Emily Bronte – endlessly reproduced – is less a portrait, more an icon. Intense, fierce, inward, solitary, elusive and unknowable: the young author of Wuthering Heights in profile is of a piece with her first, and only, novel. Her elder sister's work – Jane Eyre (no 12 in this series) – hypnotises the reader through the calculated force of its tone, its "suspended revelations", and its hints of suppressed eroticism. It builds, slowly, to a poignant climax in which, finally, its protagonists are redeemed, though not in a way that's conventional. Wuthering Heights, by contrast, plunges impetuously into a wild and passionate exploration of love in all its destructive manifestations. Brontë's narrative – fragmented, discordant and tortuous – revolves obsessively around a single, explosive transgression, and the theme of jealousy in the lives of Heathcliff and Catherine.
Jane Eyre                                                             Charlotte Bronte                        "There was no possibility of taking a walk that day." From its haunting first line to its famous closer, "Reader, I married him", Charlotte Bronte takes her audience by the throat with a fierce narrative of great immediacy. Jane Eyre's voice on the page is almost hypnotic. The reader can hardly resist turning the next page, and the next… In an extraordinary breakthrough for the English novel, borrowing the intimacy of the 18th-century epistolary tradition, Charlotte Brontë had found a way to mesmerise the reader through an intensely private communion with her audience. We, the author, and Jane Eyre become one. For this, she can be claimed as the forerunner of the novel of interior consciousness. Add to this a prose style of unvarnished simplicity and you have the Victorian novel that cast a spell over its generation.Even today, many readers will never forget the moment they first entered the strange.
Vanity Fair                                                           William Makepeace Thackeray             Vanity Fair jumps out of this list as a great Victorian novel, written and published deep in the middle of a great age of English fiction. Indeed, so commanding was Thackeray at the height of his powers (some say he never wrote as well, or as sharply, again) that Charlotte Brontë even dedicated Jane Eyre (no 12 in this list) to the author of Vanity Fair. One hundred years after the publication of Clarissa (no 4 in this series), Thackeray not only revels in the possibilities of the genre, he even illustrated his own work with some decidedly inferior woodcuts. Vanity Fair was published in serial form (including some memorable cliff-hangers, for instance Becky Sharp's revelation of her marriage to Rawdon Crawley) from January 1847 to June 1848. Thackeray, on top form, cheerfully exploited an ebullient tradition, transcending all his previous efforts as a writer.
Moby-Dick                                                             Herman Melville                         On 5 August 1850 a party of writers and publishers climbed Monument Mountain in Massachusetts, during the American equivalent of a hike in the Lakes. Among the literati on this excursion were Nathaniel Hawthorne, 46, author of The Scarlet Letter (No 16 in this series), a recently published bestseller (although a term not yet in use), and the young novelist Herman Melville, who, after a very successful debut (Typee), was struggling to complete an unwieldy coming-of-age tale about a South Seas whaler. Melville, who was just 31, had never met Hawthorne. But after a day in the open air, a quantity of champagne, and a sudden downpour, the younger man was enraptured with his new friend, who had "dropped germinous seeds into my soul". Rarely in Anglo-American literature has there been such a momentous meeting. It was the attraction of opposites. 
Madame Bovary                                                         Gustave Flaubert                        A hundred and fifty years ago tomorrow, on October 1 1856, the first episode of Madame Bovary appeared in the Revue de Paris. The serialisation was a benign act of nepotism by one of the magazine's editors, Maxime Du Camp, towards an old friend of his from student days, Gustave Flaubert. This debut came at the late age of 35: Flaubert had put himself through a long and silent apprenticeship, working out his youthful romanticism, discovering a harder and more objective way of writing, and discarding - or at least, refusing to publish - almost everything he wrote. When his collected juvenilia finally appeared in 2001 (Oeuvres de Jeunesse, Pléiade edition), they were seen to take up almost as many pages as the subsequent novels of his maturity. Flaubert had always been wary of publication, and said that when it came to finally displaying himself, he would only do so "in full armour".
The Woman in White                                                    Wilkie Collins                          One hundred and fifty years ago this week, Victorian readers opened Dickens's weekly magazine All the Year Round to find the concluding instalment of A Tale of Two Cities, and, immediately following it, the opening instalment of a new novel with no author ascribed. They joined a new protagonist, "Walter Hartright, by name," on a night-time walk over Hampstead Heath, winding on moonlit paths until they reached the intersection of the Hampstead, Finchley, West End, and London roads – somewhere in the area of where the Finchley Road tube station now stands. There they were stopped, every drop of blood in their bodies frozen still by "the touch of a hand laid lightly and suddenly" upon Walter's shoulder. And there, for the first time, they met the mysterious Anne Catherick –better known as The Woman in White.
Alice's Adventures In Wonderland                                      Lewis Carroll                           On 4 July 1862, a shy young Oxford mathematics don with a taste for puzzles and whimsy named Charles Dodgson rowed the three daughters of Henry Liddell, dean of Christ Church, five miles up the Thames to Godstow. On the way, to entertain his passengers, who included a 10-year-old named Alice, with whom he was strangely infatuated, Dodgson began to improvise the "Adventures Under Ground" of a bored young girl, also named Alice. Wordplay, logical conundrums, parody and riddles: Dodgson surpassed himself, and the girls were enchanted by the nonsense dreamworld he conjured up. The weather for this trip was reportedly "overcast", but those on board would remember it as "a golden afternoon". This well-known story marks the beginning of perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction.
Little Women                                                          Louisa M. Alcott                        Little Women is probably unique in this series: it was conceived, and commissioned, by a publisher. An instant bestseller, and a coming-of-age classic, it continues to appear in polls of Anglo-American reading, and remains among the most widely read novels of all time. Born in 1832, Louisa Alcott had grown up as the second of four daughters to a well-known Boston educationist with a penchant for reading aloud to his family from The Pilgrim's Progress. As a girl, Louisa was always "scribbling", selling her juvenile efforts to a range of publications aimed at the market for young women. By her mid-30s, Alcott had published books for children, a first novel entitled Moods, and some journalism about her experiences as a nurse in the American civil war (Hospital Sketches). Pseudonymously, she had also written several romances and adventure stories for a variety of "penny-dreadful" publications.
The Way We Live Now                                                   Anthony Trollope                        Anthony Trollope is the epitome of the 19th-century English writer, indefatigable, popular and tightly wired-in to his society, a monument of productivity. In the course of his 67 years, Trollope published more than 40 novels including two series (the Barchester Chronicles and the Pallisers) that anchored him in the public mind as the model of the Victorian literary man. His peers were less complimentary. To Henry James, he was "a novelist who hunted the fox". After the disastrous publication of his An Autobiography, his reputation became damaged by his ruthless attitude towards his art (so many words per day; his characters clinically subordinated to the needs of his narrative, and so on). Trollope's facility was held against him, and so was his popularity with a middle-class reading public. However, if there is one Trollope novel, written in a white heat during 1873.
Anna Karenina                                                         Leo Tolstoy                             What is it about Anna Karenina that gives it special status among the great novels? How is it that a sensational romantic tragedy of tsarist high society, interspersed with digressions into 19th-century Russian agricultural policy, written in a seemingly plain, straightforward style across 900 pages, still provokes both excitement and respect from readers as diverse as JM Coetzee, Jonathan Franzen and Oprah Winfrey, and lures Tom Stoppard to write the script for the latest of a dozen film adaptations? The book floats in some charmed section of the lake of literary opinion where the ripples from modernism and the ripples from Hollywood overlap without merging. It is more admired than learned from. Anna Karenina couldn't be less like a conventional modern novel. Instead of a barrage of metaphors describing things in terms of other things that they resemble.
Daniel Deronda                                                        George Eliot                            It is not necessary to resort to the invidious expedient of comparisons in order to account for the interest the announcement of a new novel by "George Eliot" has excited. Rumour, which never shrinks from busying itself with the "intentions" even of those authors who are least inclined to feel its appetite, had persistently asserted that it would be long before Middlemarch would be followed by another work of prose fiction. Whatever other work "George Eliot" may have been, or may have engaged upon, the vein to which we owe Middlemarch and Romola is not yet exhausted; and while any attempt at criticism would be out of place so long as only an instalment of Daniel Deronda is in our hands, one observation may be made with absolute safety with regard to it. The self-contained strength of matured powers is impressed upon this book.
The Brothers Karamazov                                                Fyodor Dostoevsky                       Dostoevsky's last, longest and possibly greatest novel has been known for nearly 130 years in English as The Brothers Karamazov. Sadly, this is wrong. It should be called The Karamazov Brothers. At least, so argues Ignat Avsey in his translator's note for the Oxford University Press edition of the book. "Had past translators been expressing themselves freely in natural English, without being hamstrung by the original Russian word order," he writes, "they would no more have dreamt of saying The Brothers Karamazov than they would The Brothers Warner or The Brothers Marx." He is doubtless right, but I still kind of like the very wrongness of the earlier title. The Karamazov Brothers sounds like a firm of surly plasterers; the Brothers Karamazov sound like a madcap trapeze act - which, as I (mis)read Dostoevsky, is what Ivan, Dmitri and Alexei were.
The Portrait of a Lady                                                Henry James                             Reading The Portrait of a Lady was a highlight of my late adolescence. Of James's oeuvre, I had previously read only Washington Square, with its contained canvas and early-dashed hopes, and so was unprepared for the grandeur and romance of Isabel Archer's young life, for her sweeping march out into the world and its liberties, for her conquering of Britain, Europe and beyond; and hence, too, I was unready for the tragedy that her life becomes, for the thoroughness and viciousness of her entrapment. The evil of Madame Merle and Gilbert Osmond took my breath away; as, too, did Isabel's purity and nobility, her clarity of purpose and spirit. Rather like good detergent, James's novel made life's whites whiter, its colours brighter; and the novel's blighting darkness proved as forceful, as unquestionable, as the magic of wizards. James would doubtless have been gratified by such a clear reading.
Huckleberry Finn                                                      Mark Twain                              Mark Twain began his masterpiece, he said, as "a kind of companion to Tom Sawyer". Drafted in the 1870s, the first chapters of the new book continued the old mood with the sharp ironic humour of its famous opening line: "You don't know about me, without you have read a book… made by Mr Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly." But when, after a troubled hiatus, he returned to complete the manuscript in 1883, what had begun as a reminiscent celebration became a darker elegy for a lost world. His alter ego, Sam Clemens, was appalled by the trend of American life in the fading century. For Mark Twain, the surest bulwark against the sterilising tide of progress became his pen. With Huck Finn, he could recall life on America's great river as a permanent thing, a place of menacing sunsets, starlit nights and strange dawns, of the confessions of dying men, hints of buried treasure, murderous family feuds.
The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde                             Robert Louis Stevenson                  The notion of a "Jekyll-and-Hyde" character has become a lazy way of describing someone when they do something contrary to their normal nature. But that's not quite what Dr Henry Jekyll does. Rather, he consciously searches for a chemical that will allow him to separate out the two sides to his nature. He is fascinated by the duality of man and wants to explore his darker side. Resolute and determined, eventually he succeeds. But his evil self becomes stronger over time, until it threatens to extinguish Jekyll altogether. The doctor has played with fire and he's burning from the inside. Sadly, we'll never know the thrill experienced by this explosive book's original audience. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a work of suspense, but we all know the twist these days, don't we? So why do we still read the story? Well, it's written with great economy, tension and wit. 
Three Men in a Boat                                                   Jerome K. Jerome                        An ancient river. The journey upstream of some impressionable young men into a mysterious, challenging interior. An inevitable reckoning at the source. Finally, the terrible return to reality. Here, surely, is pre-Edwardian English fiction at its classic finest. But this is not Heart of Darkness, and the river is not the Congo. Actually, it's the Thames, and the narrator is not Marlow but J, or Jerome, K Jerome. Published in 1889, 10 years before Conrad's novel, Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), is one of the comic gems in the English language. An accidental one, too. "I did not intend to write a funny book, at first," said its author. Humour in literature is often not taken as seriously as it deserves. Nevertheless, there are a few seriously funny books that remain great for all time. Three Men in a Boat is one of these. 
The Picture of Dorian Gray                                            Oscar Wilde                             The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde's eerie fable of the decadent young man whose portrait ages while he retains his youth, has inspired many works of fiction and performance, the latest being Matthew Bourne's dance drama, with Dorian updated to a superstar of modern billboard photography, an idol in blue jeans. Dorian Gray was clearly based on a living person, a member of Wilde's literary homosexual circle in the early 1890s when the story was first published. If Wilde's fiction is strange, the real life story of John Gray, Dorian's original, is even more bizarre. A young working-class poet of extraordinary beauty corrupts and is corrupted, in a lightning flash of conscience sees the error of his ways, travels to Rome to study for the priesthood, and ends his days a revered canon of the Roman Catholic church in Edinburgh. As an esoteric tale of sin and retribution, this is Oscar Wilde outdone.
Jude the Obscure                                                      Thomas Hardy                            The publication of Jude the Obscure is both an end and a beginning. In hindsight, it signals the transition to a modern literary sensibility while also painting a picture of a profoundly Victorian rural society. It was another kind of turning-point, too, because Thomas Hardy, shaken by the hostility aroused by the novel dubbed "Jude the Obscene", would never write fiction again. And it was a new beginning because henceforth he would become one of the greatest English poets of the 20th century. When the novel opens, we seem to be in Hardy's Wessex, the world of Far From the Madding Crowd or Tess of the d'Urbervilles. But Jude Fawley, who talks to the crows he is supposed to be scaring away, is a modern English boy, with his eye on Christminster (Oxford). He wants an education. With brilliant economy, Hardy opens up three themes.
The Riddle of the Sands                                               Erskine Childers                        When Charles Carruthers accepts an invitation for a yachting and duck-shooting trip to the Frisian Islands from Arthur Davies, an old chum from his Oxford days, he has no idea their holiday will become a daredevil investigation into a German plot to invade Britain. Out of context, the story of Erskine Childers's The Riddle of the Sands sounds like a bog standard thriller, but that's because so many books are pale echoes of this exceptional novel. Published in 1903, it predicted the threat of war with Germany and was so prescient in its identification of the British coast's defensive weaknesses that it influenced the siting of new naval bases. It is also credited as an inspiration to everyone from John Buchan to Ken Follett. The writing is gripping and it's a marvel that Childers manages to make the minutiae of sailing and navigation so engrossing.
The Call of the Wild                                                  Jack London                             The Call of the Wild, a short adventure novel about a sled dog named Buck (a cross between a St Bernard and a Scotch collie) will be one of the strangest, and most strangely potent, narratives in this series. Its author was a one-off, too. Jack London was a maverick, macho young man, the son of an itinerant astrologer and a spiritualist mother. As a boy, he led a criminal life, specialising in the piracy of oysters in San Francisco Bay. As a writer, he blazed briefly, lived hard and dangerously, and died from drink and drugs aged just 40, having written more than 50 books in 20 years. London is the archetype of the American writer as primeval hero, the forerunner of Hemingway, Dos Passos, Kerouac and possibly Hunter S Thompson. To George Orwell, he was "an adventurer and a man of action as few writers have ever been". 
Nostromo                                                              Joseph Conrad                           Chinua Achebe leans forward to make his point. He raises a gentle finger in the manner of a benevolent schoolmaster. "But you have to understand. Art is more than just good sentences; this is what makes this situation tragic. The man is a capable artist and as such I expect better from him. I mean, what is his point in that book? Art is not intended to put people down. If so, then art would ultimately discredit itself." Achebe does not take his eyes from me, and I stare back at him. The face is familiar and marked with the heavy lines of ageing that one would expect to find on a 72-year-old man's face. But Achebe's lines are graceful whorls which suggest wisdom. He leans back now and looks beyond me and through the window at the snowy landscape. Achebe does not take his eyes from me, and I stare back at him.
The Wind in the Willows                                               Kenneth Grahame                         The Wind in the Willows, known to many readers through theatrical adaptations such as Toad of Toad Hall, belongs to a select group of English classics whose characters (Rat, Mole, Badger and Mr Toad) and their catchphrases ("messing about in boats"; "poop, poop!") require no introduction. Endlessly recycled, in print, cartoon and cinema, the ideas and images of Kenneth Grahame's masterpiece recur in the most unlikely places. Chapter seven, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", is also the name of Pink Floyd's first album in 1967. A sentimental British favourite, The Wind in the Willows is a far more interesting book than its popular and often juvenile audience might suggest. First, it is the work of a writer who had known considerable success in the 1890s as a young contemporary of Oscar Wilde, and who was also an admired contributor to the literary quarterly The Yellow Book. 
In Search of Lost Time                                                Marcel Proust                           One good reason to re-read the first volumes of In Search of Lost Time is the new translation by Lydia Davis, blemished only by the irritating academic tic of putting numbers to references reasonably obvious to Proust readers, like Tristan and Isolde (6). Even that is tolerable after a while and finally invisible because of the grip of this fine translation. Yet I found I wanted to challenge a remark Davis makes in her introduction. She describes Odette - subject and object of Swann's love - as "fickle and shallow". I disagree. I assume that she is talking for some Proustians here, or perhaps hundreds of Proustian scholars have already disagreed with Davis. When I first read "Swann In Love", here called "A love of Swann's" (the middle section of The Way by Swann's), I drowned willingly in the declensions of the man's passion.
The Rainbow                                                           D. H. Lawrence                          I first read The Rainbow when I was 19, studying for my literature degree in the 1970s. I have dipped into it occasionally since, taking humming bird sips for inspiration. Until now, and this rereading, my image of the book was arrested in an adolescent's mould; the passages I underlined at the time show this very clearly. They are all to do with social rebellion, pastoral lyricism and sex. Some would see that as a fair summary of the book. They aren't far wrong. But what has astonished me this time round, now I'm in mellower middle age (four years older than Lawrence was when he died), is the iconoclastic modernity of the novel. Somehow, this sense of daring experiment had been smothered in memory by the opening pastoral passages and the basic sensuality of the whole. Or perhaps, at 19, one is not really equipped to judge what is new in a book published some 60 years earlier.
The Good Soldier                                                      Ford Madox Ford                         The Good Soldier is an odd and maybe even unique book. That it is a masterpiece, almost a perfect novel, comes as a repeated surprise even to readers who have read it before. In a dedicatory letter to the second edition written some 10 years after the publication of the novel, Ford depicts himself "taking down one of [his] ten-year-old books [and exclaiming] 'Great Heavens, did I write as well as that then?' ... And I will permit myself to say that I was astounded at the work I must have put into the construction of the book, at the intricate tangle of references and cross-references." Ford wrote other very good novels - his tetralogy Parade's End is moving and innovative - but he called The Good Soldier his "auk's egg" ("having reached the allotted, I had laid my one egg and might as well die"); it does have the quality of saying absolutely everything about both his story and his theme.
The Thirty-Nine Steps                                                 John Buchan                             When 39-year-old John Buchan, recuperating from a duodenal ulcer, turned to writing (in a matter of weeks) a "shocker" or "dime novel" in the first months of the first world war, he was already the admired author of more than 10 works of fiction and spoken of in literary circles as a name to watch. Indeed, Buchan might quite plausibly have become a great Scots novelist following in the footsteps of Walter Scott and RL Stevenson. Instead, with ideal timing, he wrote another kind of classic, The Thirty-Nine Steps, an archetypal English spy thriller. Long before the outbreak of war, the English reading public had become gripped by invasion fever. This was a volatile cocktail of jingoism and xenophobia inspired by the Anglo-German naval arms race and stoked by bestsellers such as The Great War in England in 1897 by William Le Queux and the infinitely greater 1903 classic The Riddle of the Sands.
Ulysses                                                               James Joyce                             1922 is one of those extraordinary years in the history of English literature – the moment when Modernism came of age, and after which nothing would ever be the same again. TS Eliot's The Waste Land appeared, first in magazine and then in volume form towards the end of the year. By then, James Joyce had already seen Ulysses, a text of approximately 265,000 words, privately published in Paris by Sylvia Beach, the philanthropic proprietor of the bookshop Shakespeare & Company, after a tortuous gestation in which his novel had been prosecuted for obscenity, and almost hounded into oblivion. Joyce, however, was creatively obdurate. Earlier, in his autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, he had made an unforgettable declaration of artistic intent. His answer to the challenge of the 20th century was to declare independence. 
Mrs Dalloway                                                          Virginia Woolf                          In the spring of 1924, Virginia Woolf, then in her 40s, gave a famous lecture, later published as the essay Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown, in which she declared that "we are trembling on the verge of one of the great ages of English literature". She might have been speaking about herself. In the next 15-odd years, before her suicide, Woolf would transform the English literary landscape forever. She would innovate (To the Lighthouse); she would flirt (Orlando); she would provoke (A Room of One's Own) and, privately, would dazzle herself and her friends with a stream of letters (and diaries), all of which reveal a writer's mind at full tilt. Woolf is one of the giants of this series, and Mrs Dalloway, her fourth novel, is one of her greatest achievements, a book whose afterlife continues to inspire new generations of writers and readers. Like Ulysses (no 46 in this series).
A Passage to India                                                    EM Forster                              In 1957, EM Forster, looking back in old age, wrote that the late-empire world of A Passage to India "no longer exists, either politically or socially". Today, approaching 100 years after its composition, the novel is probably as "dated" as ever. Yet – because Forster's concern is the forging of a relationship between a British schoolteacher and a Muslim doctor, reflecting the larger tragedy of imperialism – A Passage to India stands as a strangely timeless achievement, one of the great novels of the 20th century. The part of A Passage to India that most readers remember, of course, is the tortuous romantic drama of the Marabar caves. Thus: when Adela Quested, an English schoolteacher, and her companion Mrs Moore arrive in Chandrapore they enter colonial India, a place obsessed with the promotion of British values and the British way of life.
The Great Gatsby                                                      F. Scott Fitzgerald                     In the five years between the publication of his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920) and his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby (1925), F Scott Fitzgerald experienced the kind of literary success that can only happen in America. Fitzgerald not only coined the term "the jazz age", he lived and wrote about it with the hedonistic delirium expressed in his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922). "I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the 'impossible' come true," he wrote later. His career as the celebrity spokesman for the inter-war generation brought him money, fame, and the love of women. Looking back, he remembered that "it seemed a romantic business to be a successful literary man". The Great Gatsby is the American novel on this list that remains, after many readings, one of my all-time favourites, an unquiet masterpiece whose mystery never fails to exert its power.
The Trial                                                             Franz Kafka                             The artist, says Kafka, is the one who has nothing to say. By which he means that art, true art, carries no message, has no opinion, does not attempt to coerce or persuade, but simply – simply! – bears witness. Ironically, we find this dictum particularly hard to accept in the case of his own work, which comes to us with all the numinous weight and opacity of a secret testament, the codes of which we seem required to decrypt. The Trial, we feel, cannot be merely the simple story of a man, Josef K, who gets caught up in a judicial process – the book's German title is Der Prozeß – that will lead with nightmarish inevitability to his execution. Surely it is at least an allegory of fallen man's predicament, of his state of enduring and irredeemable guilt in a world from which all hope has been expunged. Yet the book has its direct sources in the mundane though extreme circumstances of Kafka's own life.
Men Without Women                                                     Ernest Hemingway                        "Certainly it is valuable to a trained writer to crash in an aircraft that burns," Ernest Hemingway told the Paris Review in 1958. "He learns several important things very quickly." By the time he made this statement, which seems almost to parody his macho persona, Hemingway's long and hugely successful career as a writer was effectively over. He had been in two successive plane crashes in 1954 when he had gone on safari to recapture the happiness, and perhaps the inspiration, he experienced on a similar trip to British East Africa in 1933. That expedition had inspired the last two major stories he wrote, "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro". Their publication in 1936 marked the end of a remarkable 13 years in which Hemingway left an indelible mark on the short story. Hemingway's earliest published stories are stark formal experiments.
Journey to the End of the Night                                       Louis-Ferdinand Celine                  'I'd give all of Baudelaire for an Olympic swimmer," Céline insisted. It's a provocative statement, typical of Louis-Ferdinand Destouches, who used the nom de plume of Céline. Doctor, linguist, shagger of showgirls and noted antisemite, Céline is now widely acknowledged as the greatest French prose stylist of the 20th century, despite, or perhaps partly because of, the controversy that still dogs the man and his work.I have French friends who point-blank refuse to read Céline because of the antisemitism, but there is a strong tradition in France of not just indulging, but almost demanding bad behaviour and outrage from its writers (I refer you to Houellebecq, Gide, Cocteau, Colette, Genet and Baudelaire). It tells you a lot about France, in terms of both literature and politics, that after disgracing himself during the Hitler years, Céline was back on the shelves in 1949.
As I Lay Dying                                                        William Faulkner                        This is the first, and probably the most popular, of Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County stories, a short, dark and compelling novel set in what he called “my apocryphal county”, a fictional rendering of Lafayette County in his native Mississippi. It was his ambition, he said, after the comparative failure of The Sound and the Fury, “deliberately to write a tour de force”. Apart from Mark Twain (No 23 in this series), no other American writer before Faulkner had ever immersed his readers so completely in the vernacular language and culture of a society that was, and perhaps still is, so deeply foreign to mainstream American experience. The death and burial of a southern matriarch, Addie Bundren, is told from some 15 viewpoints, including that of the dying woman herself. The Bundren family’s demanding stream-of-consciousness narrative. 
Brave New World                                                       Aldous Huxley                           The grandson of TH Huxley, an eminent Victorian scientist, and scion of a famous family of public intellectuals, Aldous Huxley was a precociously gifted young man who grew up on the fringes of the Bloomsbury set. In the 1920s, Huxley acquired a reputation for the kind of heartless, satirical fiction that appealed to the Waste Land generation. Today, he is rather out of favour, and mostly read as a curiosity of his time. I’ve put him into this series for the vivacity of his imagination as much as his prose, which is often top-heavy with ideas, and stylistically thin. Huxley’s most famous novel, a dystopian fable set in the seventh century AF (After Ford), began as a parody of HG Wells (No 39 in this series), specifically of Men Like Gods, whose optimism Huxley disdained. A jeu d’esprit quickly became a vehicle for Huxley’s obsession with the consequences of mass industrialisation.
Scoop                                                                 Evelyn Waugh                            Evelyn Waugh was born 100 years ago, on October 28, 1903. He does not seem to have died. His complex personality, reduced to a comic grotesque clutching an ear trumpet, struts and fulminates in countless anecdotes. But his real transcendence of death comes in his fiction. It is ironic that Waugh's rebarbative, bi-polar social persona should dominate his literary reputation. He was quite frank about its fictional nature. It was, he tells us in the manifestly autobiographical Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold (1957), a self-defensive imaginative construct. "It was his modesty which needed protection, and for this purpose, but without design, he gradually assumed this character of burlesque." The role he cast himself in, Waugh confesses, was a combination of eccentric don and testy colonel, a paradoxical "front of pomposity mitigated by indiscretion, that was as hard, bright and antiquated as a cuirass".
USA                                                                   John Dos Passos                         From the "gilded age" of Edith Wharton and Henry James to the rhythms of the Harlem Renaissance and Beat poets, writers have long been drawn to the east coast's biggest city. The New York Times has planned a holiday itinerary based entirely around literary landmarks, but what would be the perfect reading list to accompany a visit? For all the heiresses and eminently acceptable suitors of the fin de siècle, the quintessential New York novel of money must surely be Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. It's definitely the book to read on the first approach: "Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time."
The Big Sleep                                                         Raymond Chandler                        Seventy-five years ago this week a revolution in crime-writing began when Knopf published The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler's first novel. Reviews in 1939 were wary and unenthusiastic, however, and only gradually was it recognised that Chandler had pulled off a bold fusion of highbrow and lowbrow – much-applauded by authors such as WH Auden, Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, but also much-imitated by fellow chroniclers of murder. What was so new? Almost everything in the first chapter, which introduces Philip Marlowe as he visits the Sternwood family mansion. Marlowe speaks to us. Whereas Holmes, Poirot, Maigret, Sam Spade are observed externally, Marlowe is the detective as autobiographer, starting three consecutive sentences in the first paragraph with "I" (ending with "I was calling on four million dollars").
The Pursuit Of Love                                                   Nancy Mitford                           I read The Pursuit of Love as a child, mystified and delighted by the spirited Radletts and their terrifying father, and have returned to it at least once a year ever since. It is a darker book than I first realised, the superficial lightness concealing a faint and beguiling pessimism about love's pursuit and its consequences. Linda Radlett, the intensely English heroine, is the most beautiful of an eccentric aristocratic family closely modelled on Nancy Mitford's own. The children spend most of their days tucked up in the airing cupboard – the only warm place in their vast house – learning the rudiments of sex from Ducks and Duck Breeding and squabbling over the exact nature of Oscar Wilde's crimes. Lord Alconleigh doesn't approve of educating women – or of foreigners, intellectuals and other sundry "sewers" – while fraternising with the opposite sex is limited to hunt meets and rural dances. 
The Plague                                                            Albert Camus                            Albert Camus was the first writer I remember whose death made the news while I was growing up; my mother cried when the car crash was described on the telly. For my 1960s self, Camus was the hero of life's pointlessness, the dark prophet of resistance and its impossibility, the ultimate hip smoker and café philosopher, the contemporary writer as the messenger of bad news, tough guy and prince of cool. Camus showed how all pieties stink, and my teenage heart went molten with admiration. I read L'étranger (The Outsider) and tried to grasp such concepts as alienation and the absurd; I read La Peste (The Plague) and brought away comforting corroboration of my deeply held opinion that, yes, life was a plague, and its victims were condemned to an endless cycle of futile revolt. I wanted to go back to The Plague because I'd just read his posthumous memoir, The First Man.
Nineteen Eighty-Four                                                  George Orwell                           "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” Time is out of joint, and everyday life has no comfort any more: from Down and Out in Paris and London (1933) to Animal Farm (1945), George Orwell had been incubating a profound inner dissonance with his society. Even as a child, he had been fascinated by the futuristic imagination of HG Wells (and later, Aldous Huxley). Finally, at the end of his short life, he fulfilled his dream. Nineteen Eighty-Four, arguably the most famous English novel of the 20th century, is a zeitgeist book. Orwell’s dystopian vision was deeply rooted both in its author’s political morality, and in its time, the postwar years of western Europe. Its themes (the threat of the totalitarian state, censorship and the manipulation of language) continue to reverberate, with prophetic menace, like distant gunfire, into the present.
Malone Dies                                                           Samuel Beckett                          "The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new.” Samuel Beckett’s entry into this series with his characteristically bleak, nihilistic humour, marks another milestone: the first appearance since Shakespeare of a writer who will innovate as brilliantly in theatre as much as in poetry and prose. Beckett, indeed, is one of the giants of 20th-century literature, in any language. Murphy is an absurdist masterpiece, a first novel that emerged from a long literary apprenticeship, mainly conducted in post-first world war Paris. It was the first substantial work by a young man – Beckett was born on Good Friday, 13 April, 1906 in Foxrock, just south of Dublin – who had been experimenting for years with poetry and prose, partly influenced by James Joyce, for whom he also worked as an unconventional secretary. Murphy, which would soon become overshadowed by the international success of Waiting.
Catcher in the Rye                                                    J.D. Salinger                           The novel is said to have popularised the term "screw up", as in "Boy, it really screws up my sex life something awful. My sex life stinks." Hurrah for disaffected teenagers across the globe. Salinger spent a lot of time refusing requests to adapt the novel. Among those who have tried to get a film version made are Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. Jerry Lewis longed to play Holden Caulfield, and John Cusack is on record mourning the fact that once he was past 21, he was too old to take the role. Were it ever available. Salinger was working on a version of the book when he was fighting in the second world war. During the campaign from Normandy to Germany, he met Ernest Hemingway, with whom he went on to exchange letters. Mark David Chapman, the killer of John Lennon, so identified with the Salinger's antihero that he wanted to change his name to Holden Caulfield. 
Wise Blood                                                            Flannery O'Connor                       When Signet published the first paperback edition of Wise Blood, they advertised it as "A Searching Novel of Sin and Redemption" – making it an ideal choice for our Reading group about faith. Yet, if we are to believe Flannery O'Connor, during the book's early years there seems to have been some doubt as to whether sin and redemption were really the book's subjects. In a letter written in 1954 (to Ben Griffith, as quoted in a highly recommended lecture from Professor Amy Hungerford at Open Yale) the author wrote. Decades on, with all the mountains of articles and books written about O'Connor's Catholicism, it's hard to imagine anyone failing to see what lies at the heart of the book. ("Wise blood redemption O'Connor" just brought me a cool 166,000 hits on Google, for instance.) In fact, I find it hard to imagine that there were ever problems of interpretation. Yes, there's more to the book.
Charlotte's Web                                                       EB White                                The loving, bloodthirsty Charlotte A Cavatica of EB White's classic children's novel Charlotte's Web was inspired by a real spider, according to a new biography of the author. Michael Sims was reading White's collected letters when he found a reply to a group of schoolchildren, in which the author wrote that "I didn't like spiders at first, but then I began watching one of them, and soon saw what a wonderful creature she was and what a skilful weaver. I named her Charlotte." The comment sent Sims on a journey to discover whether there was indeed a real Charlotte, visiting White's old barn in Maine where Fern and Avery's rope still hung and finding that "there had been numerous Charlottes and Wilburs and Templetons in his life – but that there was indeed a particular clever spider who helped inspire the book".
The Lord Of The Rings                                                 J. R. R. Tolkien                        Hobbit Bilbo Baggins leaves the Shire for good and gives his magic ring to his cousin Frodo, who learns from Gandalf the wizard that this is no ordinary magic ring. It is the One Ring of Sauron, the Dark Lord and, were it to fall into Sauron's hands, he would gain complete power over the whole of Middle Earth. It must be destroyed. Together with his companions, Merry, Pippin and Sam, Frodo flees the Shire, making for Rivendell, the home of Elrond, ruler of elves. They are pursued by nine Black Riders who nearly overcome them, but on their way they meet a man called Strider who turns out to be Gandalf's friend. He guides them to Rivendell and, although Frodo is stabbed by one of the Black Riders, they arrive there safely. Elrond calls a Council. Gandalf explains that he has been held prisoner and only just escaped from the wizard Saruman who, although once an ally, now seeks the Ring for himself. 
Lucky Jim                                                             Kingsley Amis                           Has there even been a writer so choked with bile as Kingsley Amis? None of his novels look particularly kindly upon his fellow man, but Lucky Jim, his first, is driven by a particularly epic disdain for the idiocies, pedantries, mindless rules and unpleasant personal habits with which humanity is cursed. The titular Jim Dixon is an academic of a pretty poor sort, a medievalist who only picked the period because it looked like a soft option. Having clawed his way into a second-rate university he manages to cram the occasional desultory lecture around the more urgent business of persuading pretty girls to take his classes. Despite this non-specific lust, he does have a girlfriend of sorts: the grotesque Margaret, whose "tinkle of tiny silver bells" laugh will freeze the heart of any would-be coquette. Remarkable for its relentless skewering of artifice and pretension.
Lord of the Flies                                                     William Golding                         The pages of the hardback school exercise book are brittle with age while the writing is small and at times difficult to decipher. But the urgency and passion of the story shine through and famous phrases leap out: "Piggy, piggy!" then later: "Kill the pig." On Wednesday, on the 60th anniversary of the publication of Lord of the Flies, much of William Golding's archive including this handwritten draft of his most famous novel is being given on long-term loan to the University of Exeter. For the first time academics, students and members of the public will get the chance to pore over this precious early version of one of the most famous, widely-read and influential novels of the past six decades. Golding's daughter, Judy Carver, said the family wanted to make sure her father's papers, which include drafts of most of his novels, were properly preserved.
The Quiet American                                                    Graham Greene                           "I had to find a religion," said Graham Greene, "to measure my evil against." This puts Greene the "Catholic novelist" (a description he detested) into correct perspective: before he chose Christ as his highest value, he was first a man obsessed with scale itself. No 20th-century writer had a subtler mind for human comparison. Where lesser novelists deploy broad strokes to separate good guy from bad, Greene was the master of the multiple distinction: the thin lines that separate evil from cruelty from unkindness from malevolent stupidity. His people exist within a meticulously calibrated moral system. They fail by degrees. And so there is no real way to be good in Greene, there are simply a million ways to be more or less bad. This detailed ethical realism is an aspect of Greene often neglected in favour of the more baroque aspects of his oeuvre.
On the Road                                                           Jack Kerouac                            In tribute to On the Road's 50th anniversary, the books blog has been celebrating the work of Kerouac and co with a series of articles under the banner of "Beats week". But what would Kerouac think were he alive today? For starters he would probably scoff at the very name "Beats week", as would the other so-called Beats. According to Kerouac, a Times Square hustler called Herbert Huncke coined the term. Kerouac said: "Huncke appeared to us and said 'I'm beat' with radiant light shining out of his despairing eyes...a word perhaps brought from some Midwest carnival or junk cafeteria." Gary Snyder said: "I'm not a Beat poet. I never did know exactly what was meant by the term Beats." Gregory Corso summarises the slippery nature of the meaning of Beat in his essay Variations on a Generation. In 13 sections on the definition of Beat he concludes the Beat Generation is a "stupid name".
Lolita                                                                Vladimir Nabokov                        Those who wish to know what the "Lolita" row is about had better read the book rather than the denunciations of it. They may not like the book; it is certainly not to everyone's taste. Although it is written with exceptional economy and force, its subject is an abnormal and perverted man: and to some people he and the portrayal of him will be too repellent for pleasure. But others will find the narration extremely funny and the satire sharp, if bitter. What few who approach "Lolita" unprejudiced are likely to find is that it deserves the strictures of obscenity now being cast upon it. The novel, by Vladimir Nabokov, is about a man who has a passion for girls aged between 12 and 14 - creatures (for him) of mystery and allurement whom he calls nymphets. Lolita is his preferred nymphet, and the book is a record of his disastrous affair with her.
The Tin Drum                                                          Gunter Grass                            Whether it's the greatest is open to debate, but one could argue that Günter Grass's The Tin Drum is the great novel of the 20th century. By that I mean it most completely defines the era in all its glories and catastrophes – the moods, atmospheres, manias, streams, currents, histories and under-histories. First published 50 years ago this week (on 6 October 1959), it is, technically, an incredible piece of art, a melange of bildungsroman, memoir, allegory, grotesquerie and pure reverie. On a superficial level it tells the story of Oskar Matzerath: incarcerated maniac, self-created dwarf, paranoiac, possessor of supernatural gifts, vindictive genius, fallen angel, miniature tyrant, obsessive beater of the titular drum. Oskar is all of these things and none of them; the ultimate unreliable narrator. The book charts his progress, and that of the independent port city of Danzig/Gdansk.
Things Fall Apart                                                     Chinua Achebe                           Taking the Irish poet WB Yeats's despairing statement of destruction – things fall apart – for its title, Chinua Achebe's first novel was a presentiment of what was to come in Nigeria during the end of the colonial occupations and their aftermath. It is the founding creation of modern African imaginative literature, the opening act of exploration into African consciousness using traditional modes of expression along with those appropriated from colonial culture, particularly the English language. That first work was also prescient – not only of Achebe's creative powers to develop as a writer in subsequent works, but of the political upheavals, the embattled end of colonialism, the fight for freedom by which the lives of the people of Africa have been shaped. Achebe lived through these times – a tragic civil war in his country – as an activist in extreme personal danger, finally exile.
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie                                         Muriel Spark                            The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) was Muriel Spark's best novel, and Jean Brodie is one of the very few postwar fictional characters to have attained household status. But what does it mean to love a fictional character, and this one in particular? If you ask people what they "know" about Miss Brodie, they will likely recite a number of aphorisms: "I am in my prime", "you are the crème de la crème", and so on. These are Jean Brodie's famous tags. Miss Brodie, in other words, is not really "known" at all. We know her just as her young pupils knew her: as a collection of sayings, a rhetorical performance, a teacher's show. At Marcia Blaine School for girls, each member of the Brodie set is "famous" for something: Mary Macgregor is famous for being stupid, and Rose is famous for sex, and so on. Miss Brodie, it seems, is famous for her sayings. 
To Kill A Mockingbird                                                 Harper Lee                              Cynics will, of course, hear an echo of President Esposito in Woody Allen's Bananas. "From this day on, the official language of San Marcos will be Swedish." From now on, decrees Michael Gove, the official literature of England will be English literature. Gove has harped on this chauvinistic string for some time now. As he told his party conference, on assuming office: "The great tradition of our literature – Dryden, Pope, Swift, Byron, Keats, Shelley, Austen, Dickens and Hardy – should be at the heart of school life." (His indifference to Scottish literature is odd for someone who went to an Aberdeen private school.) He has expressed a personal distaste for John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. Some 90% of exam candidates answer on it, we're told. Gove clearly sees it as contaminated with the ideological prejudices of the left-leaning teaching profession.
Catch-22                                                              Joseph Heller                           The Catch-22 itself is a bureaucratic idiocy so sublime it leaves you staring out the window with wonder. As many of you will already know, the novel is set on a made-up island off the coast of Italy during the second world war, where an American bombing group is stationed. Desperate to impress his superiors, Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions his men have to fly. Our hero, Yossarian, has flown 50. Driven half-mad by his will to live, he wants out. But he's thwarted by Catch-22, a clause which states that pilots don't have to fly if they are certified as insane, but that being driven mad by fear is fundamentally rational. As it's described in the novel: "Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to." 
Herzog                                                                Saul Bellow                             If I am out of my mind, it's all right with me, thought Moses Herzog. He had fallen under the spell of writing letters that he never sent. He was alone in the big old house in the Berkshires, overcome by the need to explain, to clarify, to have it out in the kind of effortlessly superior, macho prose that would become the hallmark of his acolytes. What was his character? Narcissistic, masochistic, too knowingly un-self-aware. Well, that was Bellow. But what of him? He had been a bad husband, a bad father, a bad academic; he had failed at everything. His wife, his ex-wife Madeleine, had made him spend his $20,000 inheritance on moving from the Berkshires to Chicago and then she had left him for his friend, his ex-friend Valentine. Why had he been the last to suspect their affair? Dear Einstein, Why does everyone hate me? Dear Herzog, Because you are relatively annoying.
One Hundred Years of Solitude                                         Gabriel Garcia Marquez                  Gabriel Garcia Marquez's seminal novel One Hundred Years of Solitude is the piece of writing that has most shaped world literature over the past 25 years, according to a survey of international writers. Barack Obama's memoir, Dreams from My Father, also makes an appearance on the list of favourite works chosen by fellow writers. Indra Sinha, Blake Morrison, Amit Chaudhuri and 22 other authors were asked to pick the title that they felt had most influenced world writing over the past quarter-century. The survey was conducted by the international literary magazine Wasafiri – meaning "cultural traveller" in Swahili – which celebrates its 25th anniversary today. Marquez's novel was the only book to be selected more than once. It was chosen by three authors: Chika Unigwe, Sujata Bhatt and the Ghanaian writer Nii Ayikwei Parkes.
Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont                                          Elizabeth Taylor                        Imagine the thrill of hearing for the first time of an author of 18 moving, funny and unforgettably brilliant books; a favourite of Hilary Mantel, Sarah Waters and Anne Tyler, shortlisted for the Booker prize and adored by generations of readers. Wouldn't you rush off to investigate, so that you could experience the compassion, the wit, for yourself? Of course you would. So why haven't you read Elizabeth-Taylor-the-novelist? And, if you have, why haven't more of your friends? There are several possible reasons, all equally silly. First, that name. Of all people to be mistaken for, a violet-eyed, much-married, child prodigy-turned-star is not ideal, and the novelist soon becomes fixed as the actress's opposite: dowdy, suburban, prim. Second, her titles. Some seem insipid (A View of the Harbour) others awkward (In a Summer Season, The Wedding Group), so that most of Taylor's novels do not sound tempt.
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy                                             John Le Carre                           I should note that the quoted paragraph is more or less the exception in a review that is well worth reading for itself, rather than simply to gawp at its antiquated ideas about Le Carré's talents. Locke clearly knows the spy "genre" well and is a close and attentive reader - even if he blows it at the end by making the absurd suggestion that "in Le Carré's books everything works out". But although it's perhaps unkind to highlight the above paragraph from an otherwise decent review, it does show how far Le Carré's reputation has moved in recent years. Can you imagine anyone talking about him in such condescending terms today? Can you imagine anyone suggesting that one of the great writers of our age deserves a pat on the head for having a go at "novelistic" effects? In fact, did you even raise an eyebrow when I called Le Carre "a great writer"?
Song of Solomon                                                       Toni Morrison                           A Nobel prizewinner, a Pulitzer prizewinner and a Princeton professor to boot, Toni Morrison is a famously grand writer, one not much given to generosity when it comes to interviewers (especially, I cannot help but notice as I read over her cuttings, if they happen to be female). One poor hack, in a funk and fast running out of inquisitorial steam, made the mistake of asking her if she wrote by hand. Morrison replied: 'You've really collapsed now, haven't you?' I, too, fear saying the wrong thing, a dread that first took hold several weeks ago when - via a somewhat embarrassed publicist - I was asked how I was qualified to quiz America's 'national novelist'. What, for instance, was the name of the last American author I wrote about? At this point, my mind went completely blank. The only person I could think of was John Gray, author of Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.
The Bottle Factory Outing                                             Beryl Bainbridge                        Beryl Bainbridge's daughter, Jojo Davies, is lifting one painting after another outside into her back garden so they can be photographed in a clear light. The paintings are by her mother. Beryl Bainbridge died of cancer on 2 July last year, but her career as a novelist seems to have a life of its own. She has recently been honoured by Booker (she was shortlisted five times for the prize) with a special award for Master Georgie (1998) and her new novel, The Girl in the Polka dot Dress, is out in June (she did not complete it, but editor Brendan King has adroitly remastered it). All this would be remarkable enough, but the most extraordinary thing to emerge since her death is Bainbridge's other life: as a painter. It is already being said that if Bainbridge had not succeeded as a novelist, she would have made her name in paint. The canvases are resurfacing and an exhibition is in prospect.
The Executioner's Song                                                Norman Mailer                           It just starts - no throat-clearing, no overture, no vamping-until-ready. Coming from a writer who had made his reputation slamming doors and banging about the house, leaving the television on in one sentence while simultaneously yelling abuse at the radio and bashing out power chords in another, this was of course a surprise. Also a relief and a delight. The flatness and tight-lipped quiet of The Executioner's Song after several decades of Mailer's attention-grabbing real-life excursions (stabbing a wife, running for New York mayor) and delinquent (now sliding into seniloquent) hellclub ravings is what made it so disarming, then very quickly riveting. The simple declarative sentence, hosed clean of beardy metaphors, adverbial and adjectival excess, of discursive detail and baroque, often bonkers, "existential" riffing, is something that Mailer had always seemed congenitally incapable of writing.
If on a Winter's Night a Traveller                                    Italo Calvino                           "You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, If on a winter's night a traveller. Relax. Let the world around you fade." From the opening line of this eccentric book, which I first encountered as an undergraduate 16 years ago, I was magnetised. It was everything that A-level A Passage to India and As You Like It hadn't been. A novel that referred to its own existence? As offworldly an idea as the non-existence of the Soviet Union. A second-person protagonist? Unthinkable as two George Bushes. Then there was the novel's giddying (what I soon learned to call) intertextuality, where the protagonist "You" comes across 12 manuscripts written in the style of a Bogart movie, Borges, Chekhov, a spaghetti western, Mishima, and so on. And how about the audacious structure? Each manuscript is interrupted after too few exquisite pages.
A Bend in the River                                                   VS Naipaul                              When A Bend in the River, possibly his masterpiece, was published in 1979, I was living in America and I can still recall the excitement of handling the beautifully produced Knopf edition and travelling with Salim into Naipaul's heart of darkness in the boiling summer heat of New York City. That was the novel which seemed to place Naipaul head and shoulders above his contemporaries, and to set the edgy exactitude of his prose in a class of its own. Throughout this time, although he has written journalism when fiction was unavailable to him, although his later novels, notably The Enigma of Arrival, have hovered uneasily on the edge of autobiography, and although he has been anatomised, sometimes cruelly, in Paul Theroux's Sir Vidia's Shadow, Naipaul himself, with admirable discretion, has steered clear of the explicitly personal.
Waiting for the Barbarians                                            JM Coetzee                              At some point during the past couple of years, an eminent South African writer now living in Australia wrote this dismissive appraisal of John Maxwell Coetzee's œuvre: "In general, I would say that his work lacks ambition. The control of the elements is too tight. Nowhere do you get a feeling of a writer deforming his medium in order to say what has never been said before, which is to me the mark of great writing. Too cool, too neat, I would say. Too easy. Too lacking in passion." Even when a writer has achieved international fame and won the biggest trophies - the Nobel and two Booker prizes, in Coetzee's case - a bad review can't be easy to stomach. Harder if it is not just your book that is criticised, but the premise on which you have built your life: namely, that you can, must and should write. Worse still, if the reviewer impugns your character along with your novels.
Housekeeping                                                          Marilynne Robinson                      With the publication of Marilynne Robinson's widely praised second novel, Gilead, her first, Housekeeping, which appeared 25 years ago, should acquire new readers. It is the story of two sisters, Ruth and Lucille, who live in a small, sad town, Fingerbone, next to a lake, amongst the mountains of northwestern America. Ruth is the narrator, looking back "more than seven years" after the events of the novel to a time when she was near the end of childhood, though her age is never specified. Her vocabulary ("mantled", "cerements", "calyx") is certainly not childlike, but she does intensely relive the peculiar loneliness of her girlhood. After the suicide of their mother and the death of their grandmother, she and Lucille are looked after by their benign but remote aunt, Sylvie. A former wanderer herself, Sylvie keeps house eccentrically, and the girls roam around the lake.
Lanark                                                                Alasdair Gray                           I tripped over Lanark, literally, on the floor of a friend's house and recall quite clearly being struck by the (then) cover as I picked it up. A cheeky echo of the engraved title page of the first edition of Hobbes' Leviathan, it showed an enormous man, his corporate body and clothing made of faceless folk, wielding a sword and a crook over the city he hoped to rule by fear. The city stretched beneath his arms was a cluster of skyscrapers and factories, pylons and gasworks and clocktowers, its coastline fraught with crested waves, its hills rising through the urban sprawl like naked limbs. A closer look found the monster-humps of the Forth Bridge bounding over black, nameless water; what was surely the paddle steamer Waverley chugged a narrower channel further south. And there, no mistake, were Glasgow Cathedral and the Necropolis overlooking Dennistoun.
The New York Trilogy                                                  Paul Auster                             Some time in the middle of last summer, New York author Paul Auster finished his latest piece of writing, sat back and felt pretty happy with it. Known primarily for his thoughtful evocations of lonely urban life, Auster says that this new work "is particularly close to my heart". Surprisingly, the work in question is the preface to a thoroughly sentimental-sounding extract from Nathaniel Hawthorne's diary about his toddler son. "It's being published for Father's Day," says this exponent of what one critic referred to as "the chilled-out cool", with a suspiciously uncool smile. "Twenty Days with Julian and Little Bunny, by Papa," as the extract is titled, seems an unlikely project for Auster, who is more commonly thought of as a modern, philosophical novelist than as a sentimental one - "philosophical both in the sense of devoted to thought, and in the sense of fatalistic".
The BFG                                                               Roald Dahl                              News broke over the weekend that Steven Spielberg is set to direct a film of The BFG. It'll be the story's second adaptation; in 1989 it was made into an animated TV film. This one will be live action, say reports; the script will be by ET scriptwriter Melissa Mathison, and it's due to come out in 2016. I'm in two minds about the news. The BFG is such a huge part of my childhood reading; of the masses and acres of books I roared through, it stands out as one of the few titles of which I remember whole chunks, even today, almost verbatim. The thought of frobscottle still enchants me – delumptious, with its downwards-whizzing bubbles, and its taste of raspberries and vanilla. "'Whenever I is feeling a bit scrotty,' the BFG said, 'a few gollops of frobscottle is always making me hopscotchy again.'" And the arrival of the Fleshlumpeater still sends a quiver down my spine.
The Periodic Table                                                    Primo Levi                              It was awarded – in a very informal vote – the title of the best science book ever written, but what makes it a science book at all? Levi was a working chemist, but the title is a metaphor and even this figure of speech is sometimes a little strained to comply with the book's scheme. Some of it is personal memoir, and chapter headings such as Argon, and Iron, seem barely justified by the reflections that follow. Some stories are overtly fiction, which is surely the antithesis of science writing. One or two are attempts to address the process of industrial science from, so to speak, the floor: Sulphur is a compelling account of a wartime factory hand's hours on the night shift, but what is he making, and why does he need such temperatures, such vacuum readings? Some of it is about etymology, about the nature of words and their casual links with the elements around us.
Oscar And Lucinda                                                     Peter Carey                             It is instructive to see how Peter Carey brings off a fusion of the epic and ironic modes in this marvellous novel, Oscar And Lucinda. He constructs his narrative out of short, or shortish, sentences, often of an off-beat, ferocious elegance. (His is a style that calls attention to itself not insistently but unequivocally.) These sharp, highly coloured splinters are assembled into very many short, or shortish, chapters. Gradually, all builds into a novel of extraordinary size, in every sense of the word: yet the method of it is not unlike the way a person might set out to construct a model of the Taj Mahal out of matchsticks, and the general effect of Oscar And Lucinda does indeed have some of the unselfconscious strangeness of folk art. It is just this strangeness that undercuts the tendency towards irony, and gives Oscar Hopkins his genuinely tragic dimension.
LA Confidential                                                       James Ellroy                            James Ellroy has been described as the "klng of meta-historical, postmodern, hard-boiled noir". Joining the book club to discuss his 1987 novel The Black Dahlia, the first in his celebrated LA quartet of novels, he explains why "postmodernity" is irrelevant to him. He's more into the "hepcat, hipster" culture that characterised the Los Angeles of the 1940s and 50s in which his novels are set. Los Angeles, profanity and political correctness are among the subjects he explores in a wide-ranging discussion of a novel based on a real-life murder that happened a year before he was born, and which reflected the murder of his own mother more than a decade later.
Wise Children                                                         Angela Carter                           Two households, both in questionable and vacillating states of dignity. The first is the grand theatrical Hazard dynasty, whose patriarch is the roaring, brooding Melchior Hazard, a Shakespearian ham with a voice “as hot and strong as Bovril”. The second is the scrappy family cobbled together around the identical Chance twins, Melchior’s illegitimate daughters. Dismissed by their celebrity father, they are raised in Brixton by their dead mother’s landlady - a vegan naturist they call Grandma. In his second household, the heart of the novel, the sisters caper along the breadline through sheer stubbornness. As Dora and Nora Chance grow up, they learn to sing and dance for their supper, and are watched over by a fairy godfather in the form of Peregrine Hazard, their father’s fraternal twin but emotional opposite. 
Atonement                                                             Ian McEwan                              The play - for which Briony had designed the posters, programmes and tickets, constructed the sales booth out of a folding screen tipped on its side, and lined the collection box in red crepe paper - was written by her in a two-day tempest of composition, causing her to miss a breakfast and a lunch. When the preparations were complete, she had nothing to do but contemplate her finished draft and wait for the appearance of her cousins from the distant north. There would be time for only one day of rehearsal before her brother arrived. At some moments chilling, at others desperately sad, the play told a tale of the heart whose message, conveyed in a rhyming prologue, was that love which did not build a foundation on good sense was doomed. The reckless passion of the heroine, Arabella.
Northern Lights                                                       Philip Pullman                          The opening book of His Dark Materials, Philip Pullman's epic trilogy of wonder and love, won the supreme accolade in its field last night. Northern Lights was declared the finest children's book of the past 70 years, handsomely topping a readers' poll as the best winner of the annual Carnegie medal published in that time. Pullman's trilogy has sold 15m copies and brought him a £192,000 prize from the Swedish government, the richest next to the Nobel. Yet the Carnegie of Carnegies 70th anniversary medal was "without any question the most important honour I have ever received, and the one I treasure the most", he said last night. Northern Lights was published 12 years ago. Its first award was the Guardian children's fiction prize, before it went on to win the 1995 Carnegie. Pullman believed the story it introduces - of a girl and boy leading the struggle of multiple universes to throw off.
American Pastoral                                                     Philip Roth                             Having spent a good part of two decades scrutinising his imagination, examining its origins and doubting, obsessively, its integrity Philip Roth, now in his mid sixties, seems determined simply to employ his gift in all its extraordinary vigour. Hard at the heels of Sabbath's Theater, and its remarkable whoring hero, the great pretender has, with American Pastoral, produced his second masterpiece within two years. We open in familiar Roth territory: Newark, New Jersey; and a half-lit age of post-war hopefulness, a time when New York was still a city of old-world craftsmen and new-world chancers, and 'atomic energy was all our own'. The focus of all that optimism, all that energy, at least in Newark's Weequahic High School, rests in the frame of Seymour 'Swede' Levov: a blond-haired, blue-eyed Jew, effortless star of every sport he plays. 
Austerlitz                                                            W. G. Sebald                            In W G Sebald's The Rings of Saturn, which helped him acquire a large British reputation, one of the more memorable scenes - intentionally or otherwise - involved a fogeyish narrator, staying at an empty seaside hotel in Suffolk, attempting to eat fish and chips. The fish, Sebald begins,"had doubtless lain entombed in the deep-freeze for years... The breadcrumb armour-plating had been partly singed by the grill, and the prongs of my fork bent on it... The tartare sauce was turned grey by the sooty breadcrumbs." When the narrator finally manages to bite into his fillet, he finds "nothing but an empty shell". To load a bad meal in a small English town with so much morbid imagery takes a certain confidence. But so hypnotic were Sebald's sentences, and so suggestive the connections he kept making between his depressed narrator's minor wanderings and whole galaxies of grim forgotten history.
